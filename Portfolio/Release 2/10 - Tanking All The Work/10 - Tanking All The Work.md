# 10 - Tank All The Work
For my final trick, I would like to show the workload
between all the members for the development. I feel that this
is worth at least 10 artifacts by itself...

At 9,595 new lines, and 5,755 cleared lines, I feel that the workload 
was absolutely ridiculous for this unit. I had to drop a thesis to complete 
this...

The next member with best contributions was Jessica, at 1,509 new lines, 
and 1,268 removed lines.
