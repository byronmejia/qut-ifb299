# 08 - MVC Design Pattern
A large chunk of my time for this second release was spent reorganizing 
how the files were structured to closely resemble that of an MVC pattern. 

Express.JS has this really bad method, of teaching new developers how to write
monolithic, tightly coupled code with dependency cycles inside. This is 
terrible practice and I felt the app would make more sense if it was to be designed
around the MVC pattern. 

A framework from a more supportive community would have made more sense, for example,
Ruby on Rails, or Java Spring. 

This started from this commit, all the way until commit hash: 24e037967ff15e1e2e34ad2dee8bbe68a59cd966
