# 09 - Documentation
An important aspect of developing as a team is to be able to write, 
both clean code, and ensure others who come back may have a better
understanding fo the cod written. 

For this task, I went through many of the functions build, and 
wrote a comment and the relevant author (a majority being
either myself, or Jessica Barron).

All comments throughout the code have been started by me. This 
can be seen through the gitlog if the marker is not buying it, 
via GitHub.

An example of a comment written by myself includes:
  - https://github.com/byronmejia/qut-ifb299/commit/e19ed4cdf62ae7210f3943e3056fa34a0a0fd3bc

JSDocs was used to try and create documentation, however, I did not 
have the time to write all that, or learn how documentation works in 
NodeJS. Other team members were supposed to catch up and build these, 
but that never occurred.
