# 06 - Adding Integration Tests
Integration testing is an important feature of
developing in a collaborative group. For this project, 
as all developers were learning NodeJS (as Tylor had set out
the stack from the beginning of the semester), many of the 
modules within the program were created tightly coupled
with each other. These issues were not present until 
beginning to write the tests for this project. Unfortunately, 
no one who said that they would write the tests ended up writing 
any of them, so, all tests were also written by me.

These tests unfortunately only test integration, and not the 
individual modules themselves.
