# 03 - Setting Up Hello World, by myself...
As part of one of the early activities in the semester,
we were required to complete a 'hello world' task completed, and deployed.

I researched into using Heroku for this, and also followed the ExpressJS
Hello World tutorial.

I followed a bit of this tutorial specifically here:
