# Byron Mejia's Portfolio

## What does this include?
In this folder contains each artifact with a few words stating
the reasoning behind some of the decisions created, or the learning
outcomes from them. 

## What this does not include?
This repository does not include any binary files. Only source files.
Git was built to be used as a version control system, and explicitally,
requires build artifacts to be ignored. Git was never build to be abused
in the way that this unit wants. 

Please see: https://github.com/github/gitignore for example ignore files
(many which include build artifacts)

And reasons for not uploading binaries to git, ever:
