# IFB 299 - Application Development - Personal Portfolio

Pair Programming was used in this project along side Stephen Downer.
Due to this, all commits are under my GitHub account and we have split the applicable artifacts
between us, as per the instruction of out tutor.

Evidence for artifacts is either previously submitted assessment, available on our project
management platform (Taiga) or available in the artifacts directory.

## Release 1
### Artifact 1: User Story Acceptance Criteria
Collaboratively wrote Acceptance Criteria for all of our user stories with the group.
This was done collaboratively to ensure all developers were aware of all user stories
and to ensure all edge cases were covered in acceptance criteria where possible.

### Artifact 2: Event Registration Text Email Template
Created a text template to be user for the event registration emails on PostMark.

### Artifact 3: Event Cancellation Text Email Template
Created a text template to be user for the event cancellation emails on PostMark.

### Artifact 4: Event Registration Email Handler
I wrote a method to handle the sending of event registration emails.

### Artifact 5: Event Cancellation Email Handler.
I wrote a method to handle the sending of event cancellation emails.

### Artifact 6: Business Letter
Collaboratively wrote the Business Letter to our development team after the release one presentation.
This was done collaboratively to ensure the highest quality result possible.

## Release 2
### Artifact 1: User Stories and Acceptance Criteria
After Release 1 some of our user stories were incomplete due to unexpected complexity of some tasks.
This resulted in us needing to re-evaluate acceptance criteria and story points for the remaining
tasks and re-assign them into sprints three and four, resulting in some scope from those sprints
being moved into sprint five. I was responsible in assisting with the decision making of this process.

### Artifact 2: Event Registration HTML Email Template
Created a html template to be user for the event registration emails on PostMark.

### Artifact 3: Event Cancellation HTML Email Template
Created a html template to be user for the event cancellation emails on PostMark.

### Artifact 4: Database Migration
Wrote a database migration to add notification preferences to user profiles.

### Artifact 5: Notifications Module
Compiled each of the email methods into a single module to be used for a notification service.

### Artifact 6: Business Letter
Collaboratively wrote the Business Letter to our development team after the release two presentation.
This was done collaboratively to ensure the highest quality result possible.
