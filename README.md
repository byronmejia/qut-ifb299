## Getting Started
### Preface
**Before you commit anything** ensure that you follow the following style
guides, including:
  - [Design Style Guide](https://tree.taiga.io/project/byronmejia-ifb299-community-platform/wiki/design-style-guide)
  - [Development Style Guide](https://tree.taiga.io/project/byronmejia-ifb299-community-platform/wiki/development-style-guide)
  - [Git Style Guide](https://tree.taiga.io/project/byronmejia-ifb299-community-platform/wiki/git-style-guide)

After ensuring that you are comfortable with each, you may begin work
on the project. Developers should make themselves most comfortable with
the development style guide, design with design, and both should be
comfortable with git style guide.

### Development Tools
For development, NodeJS will be used for server-side endpoints. This will
interact with a 

Issue tracking will be completed via GitHub Issue tracker. For more
information on how the project's GitHub Issue tracker works, please see
[Issue Tracker](https://tree.taiga.io/project/byronmejia-ifb299-community-platform/wiki/issue-tracking-guide).

### Setting up Node.JS
It is recommended that you use a node.js manager, for dependencies.

If you are a *nix user, use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

If you are a windows user, use [NVM-Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).

Then, install the project's node.js version
```sh
nvm install 6.3.1
```

And when you are working in the project directory, switch to the appropiate node version with
```sh
nvm use
```

### Production setup
Heroku does everything. We should be okay. I hope....
